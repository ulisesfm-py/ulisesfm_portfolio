                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Land segmentation from aerial imagery is a challenging problem in remote sensing and computer
                    vision, requiring accurate classification of different land use types such as water, land, roads,
                    buildings, and vegetation. In this project, I explored three different models — a U-Net neural
                    network, a Logistic Regression model, and a Random Forest Classifier — for segmenting land use from
                    aerial images. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle, consisting of labeled aerial images for
                    semantic segmentation tasks. The objective was to evaluate the performance of deep learning against
                    traditional machine learning models for this classification problem.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Preparation and Preprocessing</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The dataset consisted of high-resolution aerial images, each paired with a corresponding mask image
                    that denotes different land use types using color codes. To make the data suitable for training the
                    models, the following steps were performed: <strong>image resizing, data augmentation, class
                        balancing, and
                        mask conversion.</strong>
                </p>

                <!-- Placeholder for dataset images -->
                <img src="/dataset_real_mask.a5badaf7.png" alt="Dataset Real and Mask Image">

                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Input images from the dataset have different resolutions, so I cropped them into multiple 256 x 256
                    pixel images. This way, all trained images and predictions would have the same size. Then, it was
                    possible to convert those images into arrays
                    of size <strong>(n, img_height, img_width, channels)</strong>. In this case, n is the number of
                    images
                    in the dataset after cropping, img_height and img_width are 256 pixels each, and channels is 3 for
                    RGB
                    and 1 if they are in gray-scale.
                </p>

                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    After resizing and cropping the images, we extracted the unique colors from the masks to identify
                    the different classes (e.g., water, land, roads, etc.) present in the dataset. A dictionary mapping
                    RGB values to class labels was created, which facilitated converting the RGB masks to categorical
                    labels necessary for model training.
                </p>

                <h3>Model Development and Training</h3>
                <h4>U-Net Model</h4>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The U-Net architecture is widely used for semantic segmentation tasks in deep learning. In this
                    project, the U-Net model was trained using a custom loss function — Categorical Focal Loss — which
                    focuses on difficult-to-classify pixels. The model was optimized using the Adam optimizer and
                    trained for 50 epochs on a GPU to leverage accelerated computing power.
                </p>

                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    To handle the class imbalance issue, class weights were computed and used during training. These
                    weights help the model to focus more on less frequent classes. Data augmentation techniques such as
                    rotation, flipping, and zooming were also applied to increase the diversity of training data and
                    prevent overfitting.
                </p>

                <h4>Logistic Regression Model</h4>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary
                    classification tasks. For the purpose of pixel-wise multi-class classification in this project, the
                    RGB values of each pixel were used as features, and the corresponding class label was the target
                    variable.
                </p>

                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Before training, we created a pixel-wise dataset where each pixel in the image was treated as an
                    independent sample. The RGB values served as input features, and the corresponding pixel class was
                    the target. A logistic regression model was then trained using balanced class weights to address the
                    class imbalance issue.
                </p>

                <h4>Random Forest Classifier</h4>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training
                    and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks. Similar to the Logistic Regression
                    model, the Random Forest Classifier was trained using pixel data.
                </p>

                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The Random Forest Classifier was trained using the same pixel-wise dataset created for the Logistic
                    Regression model. It is robust to overfitting and can capture feature interactions better, leading
                    to improved performance over logistic regression in many cases. The results from this model were
                    compared against those from the U-Net model.
                </p>

                <h3>Results and Performance Comparison</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The performance of the three models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
                    metrics. The U-Net model, owing to its deep learning architecture, excelled in capturing complex
                    spatial dependencies and provided the highest overall accuracy. However, the Logistic Regression and
                    Random Forest models, while computationally less expensive, also delivered respectable results for
                    simpler segmentation tasks.
                </p>

                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The confusion matrices for all three models were plotted to analyze the misclassification patterns.
                    The U-Net model showed fewer misclassifications, particularly for overlapping classes like 'road'
                    and 'building', compared to the other models. The logistic regression and random forest classifiers
                    were simpler models but still provided reasonable accuracy given their computational simplicity.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    This project successfully demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of both deep learning
                    (U-Net) and traditional machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) methods for land
                    segmentation classification. While the U-Net model provided superior accuracy, the machine learning
                    models offered simpler and faster alternatives with reasonable performance.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Future directions for this project could include experimenting with more advanced deep learning
                    models like DeepLabV3+ or incorporating transfer learning techniques. Additional work can be done to
                    optimize the training process, such as hyperparameter tuning, or to try other loss functions like
                    Dice Loss for better segmentation performance.
